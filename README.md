Group project for machine learning course at nmsu:

goal: to produce a reliable model to classify different photos of sneakers

- [x] used knn Keras CNN to train our 7 image sets

- [x] predict 7 different labels for sneakers.

- [x] train real/fake sneakers [accuracy 0.91].

- [x] predict real/fake sneakers[accuracy 0.77].
